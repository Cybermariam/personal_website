        <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
        <p>
          My goal for the next two years is to become highly proficient and
          confident in frontend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first year, I will focus on hands-on projects. I firmly believe
          that practical experience is essential for mastering web development.
          By taking on various projects, I will be able to apply what I learn in
          real-world scenarios, which will significantly enhance my skills and
          understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simultaneously, I will strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript and
          React, ensuring a solid foundation in these critical technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I have a strong grasp of JavaScript and React, I will begin
          learning TypeScript, recognizing its importance in frontend
          development for adding static types and improving code quality.
          Throughout this journey, I will prioritize making my code efficient
          and maintainable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I will work on enhancing my problem-solving skills,
          which are crucial for tackling complex development challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          By continuously learning and applying my knowledge through projects, I
          aim to become an expert in frontend development, positioning myself as
          a confident and skilled developer in the industry.
